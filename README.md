## Mark Sadegi's Dotfiles

Currently patterned off of [mislav's dotfiles](https://github.com/mislav/dotfiles).

I really like [tpope's dotfiles](https://github.com/tpope/tpope) but they are currently a bit advanced for me.

Also, check out [Ben Orenstein's dotfiles](https://github.com/r00k/dotfiles).
